# Aerios Linux

A attempt at a Debian-based distro for fun. Our goal is being lightweight to run while actually looking decent out of the box.
*This is mostly just a fun project for us to make.*

## Developers:

> Decentcarp - Core System (main)

> Kevadesu - Core System & Installer 

> Polyreef - Installer (main)

> Phantom - UI/UX Design (main)

> Mimka - Exists. Literally, that's it.

**With lots of love, from Decentcarp (and the rest of us).**
