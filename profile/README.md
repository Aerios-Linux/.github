# Aerios Linux

A attempt at a Debian-based distro for fun. Our goal is being lightweight to run while actually looking decent out of the box.
*This is mostly just a fun project for us to make.*

## Developers:

> Decentcarp - Core System 

> Kevadesu - All around, helps me with core system and will probably help with installer.

> Holmfrost - Installer 

> Phantom - UI/UX Design

> Mimka - Exists. Literally, that's it.

**With lots of love, from Decentcarp (and the rest of us).**
